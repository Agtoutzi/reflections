What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a folder in order to keep information and all the files neccessary 
for keeping track of the commits and repository. Without initialization git is 
not able to keep the history of the files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the middle stage between the working directory and the 
repository. It holds the files that will be saved in the next commit. This way 
the user can control the commits as he wishes.
