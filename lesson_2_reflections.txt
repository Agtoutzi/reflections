What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a folder in order to keep information and all the files neccessary 
for keeping track of the commits and repository. Without initialization git is 
not able to keep the history of the files.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the middle stage between the working directory and the 
repository. It holds the files that will be saved in the next commit. This way 
the user can control the commits as he wishes. 


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

By adding to the staging area the file that tis logical change was made and 
creating a commit. You can always compare the change you made by using git diff 
and git diff --staged commands. The first one compares the difference between 
your changes in the working depository and the staging area and the second 
compares the files between the staging area and the previous commit.
