When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?

When i need to share work with others, or need access to it from other systems. 
When you upload your work you can see it wherever you like using a computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would not always want this. Sometimes i need to review some change that has 
been uploaded to the remote repository and decide whether to keep them and 
integrate it to my local repository or discard it. Or sometimes when someone 
makes some changes to the remote repository is not finished so i should not pull 
these changes just yet because they are not complete.
