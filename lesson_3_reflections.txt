When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

When i need to share work with others, or need access to it from other systems. 
When you upload your work you can see it wherever you like using a computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would not always want this. Sometimes i need to review some change that has 
been uploaded to the remote repository and decide whether to keep them and 
integrate it to my local repository or discard it. Or sometimes when someone 
makes some changes to the remote repository is not finished so i should not 
pull these changes just yet because they are not complete.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

Fork copies a repository from another GitHub user to your GitHub profile. You 
use it when you want to take a copy and work on another one's code. You cannot 
change the original files on his GitHub repository. Clone is when you copy a 
repository from a local or remote folder to your "working" folder. You use 
clone when you want to get a copy of your own repository over GitHub or 
someone else's repository on which you cannot connect your local repository to 
perform changes. Also when you locally want to copy a repository from a place 
to another. Branch is when you create a new path on your repository to keep 
the parent path unchanged. You use it to perform changes or try new things but 
also keep the original branch unharmed. When you are finished with your branch 
you can merge it to its parent branch to integrate these changes to the 
latter. You can create new branches either locally or on GitHub.
